    column. When equal to -1, the fluid density will be calculated using one or more species entered in the table at
    the bottom of the dialog using species ID, DRHODC, and CRHOREF. Rows can be entered into the table with the tool
    bar below the table. When greater than or equal to 1 density is calculated using the corresponding species

  drhodc: <div>The slope of the linear equation of state that relates fluid density to solute concentration.</div>,
  mfnadvfd: <div>Flag that determines the method for calculating the internodal density values used to conserve fluid
    mass. If MFNADVFD = 2, internodal conductance values used to conserve fluid mass are calculated using a

    maximum number of non-linear coupling iterations for the flow and transport solutions. SEAWAT-2000 will stop
    execution after NSWTCPL iterations if convergence between flow and transport has not occurred. If NSWTCPL = -1,

    between two consecutive implicit coupling iterations is not less than DNSCRIT, the program will continue to
    iterate on the flow and transport equations, or will terminate if NSWTCPL is reached. If NSWTCPL is -1, DNSCRIT
    is the maximum density threshold, in units of fluid density. If the fluid density change (between the present

    larger than DENSEMAX is automatically reset to DENSEMAX.</div>,
  iwtable: <div>Flag used to activate the variable-density water-table corrections (Guo and Langevin, 2002, eq. 82).

    VISCMIN is automatically reset to VISCMIN.</div>,
  viscmax: <div>Maximum fluid viscosity. If the resulting viscosity value calculated with the equation is greater than
    VISCMAX, the viscosity value is set to VISCMAX. If VISCMAX = 0, the computed fluid viscosity is not limited by

    VISCMAX is automatically reset to VISCMAX.</div>,

  mutempopt: <div>Flag that specifies the option for including the effect of temperature on fluid viscosity. If
    MUTEMPOPT = 0, the effect of temperature on fluid viscosity is not included or is a simple linear relation that
    is specified in item 3c. If MUTEMPOPT = 1, fluid viscosity is calculated using equation 18. The size of the

    19. The size of the AMUCOEFF array in item 3e is 5 (MUNCOEFF = 5). If MUTEMPOPT = 3, fluid viscosity is
    calculated using equation 20. The size of the AMUCOEFF array in item 3e is 2 (MUNCOEFF = 2). If NSMUEOS and

  // SOLVER Packages

  // DE4
  de4: {
    itmx: <div>Maximum number of iterations for each time step. Specify ITMAX = 1 if iteration is not desired.
      Ideally iteration would not be required for direct solution. However, it is necessary to iterate if the flow
      equation is nonlinear or if computer precision limitations result in inaccurate calculations as indicated by
      a large water budget error (default is 50).</div>,
    mxup: <div>Maximum number of equations in the upper part of the equations to be solved. This value impacts the
      amount of memory used by the DE4 Package. If specified as 0, the program will calculate MXUP as half the
      number of cells in the model, which is an upper limit (default is 0).</div>,
    mxlow: <div>Maximum number of equations in the lower part of equations to be solved. This value impacts the
      amount of memory used by the DE4 Package. If specified as 0, the program will calculate MXLOW as half the
      number of cells in the model, which is an upper limit (default is 0).</div>,
    mxbw: <div>Maximum band width plus 1 of the lower part of the head coefficients matrix. This value impacts the
      amount of memory used by the DE4 Package. If specified as 0, the program will calculate MXBW as the product
      of the two smallest grid dimensions plus 1, which is an upper limit (default is 0).</div>,
    ifreq: <div>Flag indicating the frequency at which coefficients in head matrix change. IFREQ = 1 indicates that
      the flow equations are linear and that coefficients of simulated head for all stress terms are constant for
      all stress periods. IFREQ = 2 indicates that the flow equations are linear, but coefficients of simulated
      head for some stress terms may change at the start of each stress period. IFREQ = 3 indicates that a
      nonlinear flow equation is being solved, which means that some terms in the head coefficients matrix depend
      on simulated head (default is 3).</div>,
    mutd4: <div>Flag that indicates the quantity of information that is printed when convergence information is
      printed for a time step. MUTD4 = 0 indicates that the number of iterations in the time step and the maximum
      head change each iteration are printed. MUTD4 = 1 indicates that only the number of iterations in the time
      step is printed. MUTD4 = 2 indicates no information is printed (default is 0).</div>,
    accl: <div>Multiplier for the computed head change for each iteration. Normally this value is 1. A value greater
      than 1 may be useful for improving the rate of convergence when using external iteration to solve nonlinear
      problems (default is 1).</div>,
    iprd4: <div>Time step interval for printing out convergence information when iterating (ITMX &gt; 1). If IPRD4 is
      2, convergence information is printed every other time step. A value must always be specified even if not
      iterating (default is 1).</div>,

  // GMG
  gmg: {
    mxiter: <div>For linear problems, set to 1. For nonlinear problems, set to a higher number though it is usually
      unnecessary to go above 100.</div>,
    iiter: <div>is the maximum number of PCG iterations for each linear solution. A value of 100 is typically
      sufficient. It is frequently useful to specify a smaller number for nonlinear problems so as to prevent an
      excessive number of inner iterations.</div>,
    iadamp: <div>is a flag that controls adaptive damping. The possible values of <strong>iadamp</strong> and their
      meanings are as follows:<br /><br />
      • If <strong>iadamp</strong> = 0, then the value assigned to <strong>damp</strong> is used as a constant
      damping parameter.<br />
      • If <strong>iadamp</strong> = 1, the value of <strong>damp</strong> is used for the first nonlinear
      iteration. The damping parameter is adaptively varied on the basis of the head change, using Cooley’s method
      as described in Mehl and Hill (2001), for subsequent iterations.<br />
      • If <strong>iadamp</strong> = 2, the relative reduced residual damping method documented in Mehl and Hill
      (2001) and modified by Banta (2006) is used.<br /><br />
      When <strong>iadamp</strong> is specified as 2 and the value specified for <strong>damp</strong> is less
      than 0.5, the closure criterion for the inner iterations (DRCLOSE) is assigned simply
      as <strong>rclose</strong>. When <strong>damp</strong> is between 0.5 and 1.0, inclusive, or
      when <strong>iadamp</strong> is specified as 0 or 1, DRCLOSE is calculated according to equation 20 on p. 9
      of Wilson and Naff (2004).</div>,
    hclose: <div>is the head change convergence criterion for nonlinear problems. After each linear solve (inner
      iteration), the maxnorm of the head change is compared
      against <strong>hclose</strong>. <strong>hclose</strong> can be set to a large number for linear
      problems; <strong>hclose</strong> is ignored if <strong>mxiter</strong>=1.</div>,
    rclose: <div>is the residual convergence criterion for the inner iteration. The PCG algorithm computes the
      l2norm of the residual and compares it against <strong>rclose</strong>.
      Typically, <strong>rclose</strong> is set to the same value as <strong>hclose</strong> (see below).
      If <strong>rclose</strong> is set too high, then additional outer iterations may be required due to the
      linear equation not being solved with sufficient accuracy. On the other hand, a too restrictive setting
      for <strong>rclose</strong> for nonlinear problems may force an unnecessarily accurate linear solution. This
      may be alleviated with the IITER parameter or with damping.</div>,
    relax: <div>is a relaxation parameter for the ILU preconditioned conjugate gradient method.
      The <strong>relax</strong> parameter can be used to improve the spectral condition number of the ILU
      preconditioned system. The value of <strong>relax</strong> should be approximately one. However, the
      relaxation parameter can cause the factorization to break down. If this happens, then the GMG solver will
      report an assembly error and a value smaller than one for <strong>relax</strong> should be tried. This item
      is read only if ISC = 4.</div>,
    ioutgmg: <div>is a flag that controls the output of the GMG solver. The possible values
      of <strong>ioutgmg</strong> and their meanings are as follows:<br /><br />
      • If <strong>ioutgmg</strong> = 0, then only the solver inputs are printed.<br />
      • If <strong>ioutgmg</strong> =1, then for each linear solve, the number of PCG iterations, the value of the
      damping parameter, the l2norm of the residual, and the maxnorm of the head change and its location (column,
      row, layer) are printed. At the end of a time/stress period, the total number of GMG calls, PCG iterations,
      and a running total of PCG iterations for all time/stress periods are printed.<br />
      • If <strong>ioutgmg</strong> = 2, then the convergence history of the PCG iteration is printed, showing the
      l2norm of the residual and the convergence factor for each iteration.<br />
      • <strong>ioutgmg</strong> =3 is the same as <strong>ioutgmg</strong> =1 except output is sent to the
      terminal instead of the MF2K LIST output file.<br />
      • <strong>ioutgmg</strong> =4 is the same as <strong>ioutgmg</strong> =2 except output is sent to the
      terminal instead of the MF2K LIST output file.
    </div>,
    iunitmhc: <div>is a flag and a unit number, which controls output of maximum head change values:<br /><br />
      • If <strong>iunitmhc</strong> = 0, maximum head change values are not written to an output file.<br />
      • If <strong>iunitmhc</strong> &#62; 0, maximum head change values are written to
      unit <strong>iunitmhc</strong>. Unit <strong>iunitmhc</strong> should be listed in the Name file with “DATA”
      as the file type.<br />
      • If <strong>iunitmhc</strong> &#60; 0 or is not present, <strong>iunitmhc</strong> defaults to 0.
    </div>,
    ism: <div>is a flag that controls the type of smoother used in the multigrid preconditioner. The possible values
      for <strong>ism</strong> and their meanings are as follows:<br /><br />
      • If <strong>ism</strong> = 0, then ILU(0) smoothing is implemented in the multigrid preconditioner. This
      smoothing requires an additional vector on each multigrid level to store the pivots in the ILU
      factorization.<br />
      • If <strong>ism</strong> = 1, then Symmetric GaussSeidel (SGS) smoothing is implemented in the multigrid
      preconditioner. No additional storage is required for this smoother; users may want to use this option if
      available memory is exceeded or nearly exceeded when using <strong>ism</strong>=0. Using SGS smoothing is
      not as robust as ILU smoothing; additional iterations are likely to be required in reducing the residuals.
      In extreme cases, the solver may fail to converge as the residuals cannot be reduced sufficiently.</div>,
    isc: <div>is a flag that controls semicoarsening in the multigrid preconditioner. The possible values
      of <strong>isc</strong> and their meanings are given as follows:<br /><br />
      • If <strong>isc</strong> = 0, then the rows, columns and layers are all coarsened.<br />
      • If <strong>isc</strong> = 1, then the rows and columns are coarsened, but the layers are not.<br />
      • If <strong>isc</strong> = 2, then the columns and layers are coarsened, but the rows are not.<br />
      • If <strong>isc</strong> = 3, then the rows and layers are coarsened, but the columns are not.<br />
      • If <strong>isc</strong> = 4, then there is no coarsening.<br /><br />
      Typically, the value of <strong>isc</strong> should be 0 or 1. In the case that there are large vertical
      variations in the hydraulic conductivities, then a value of 1 should be used (see Remark 9 in “CoarseGrid
      Correction” section of Wilson and Naff (2004)). If no coarsening is implemented (<strong>isc</strong> = 4),
      then the GMG solver is comparable to the PCG2 ILU(0) solver described in Hill (1990) and uses the least
      amount of memory.</div>,
    damp: <div>is the value of the damping parameter. For linear problems, a value of 1.0 should be used. For
      nonlinear problems, a value less than 1.0 but greater than 0.0 may be necessary to achieve convergence. A
      typical value for nonlinear problems is 0.5. Damping also helps control the convergence criterion of the
      linear solve to alleviate excessive PCG iterations (see equation (20).</div>,
    dup: <div>is the maximum damping value that should be applied at any iteration when the solver is not
      oscillating; it is dimensionless. An appropriate value for <strong>dup</strong> will be problem-dependent.
      For moderately nonlinear problems, reasonable values for <strong>dup</strong> would be in the range 0.5 to
      1.0. For a highly nonlinear problem, a reasonable value for <strong>dup</strong> could be as small as 0.1.
      When the solver is oscillating, a damping value as large as 2.0*<strong>dup</strong> may be applied.</div>,
    dlow: <div>is the minimum damping value to be generated by the adaptive-damping procedure; it is dimensionless.
      An appropriate value for <strong>dlow</strong> will be problem-dependent and will be smaller than the value
      specified for <strong>dup</strong>. For a highly nonlinear problem, an appropriate value
      for <strong>dlow</strong> might be as small as 0.001. Note that the value specified for the next
      variable, <strong>chglimit</strong>, could result in application of a damping value smaller
      than <strong>dlow</strong>.</div>,
    chglimit: <div>is the maximum allowed head change at any cell between outer iterations; it has units of length.
      The effect of <strong>chglimit</strong> is to determine a damping value that, when applied to all elements
      of the head-change vector, will produce an absolute maximum head change equal to <strong>chglimit</strong>.

      iterations. <strong>dbdtheta</strong> is used to control oscillations in head. Values range between 0.0 and

      (default is 0).<br />
      If <strong>ihcofadd</strong>=0, cell converts to dry regardless of HCOF value. This is the default, which is

      of head change from all nodes during an iteration is less than or equal to <strong>hclose</strong>, and the

      When the maximum absolute value of the residual at all nodes during an iteration is less than or equal

      For nonlinear problems, convergence is achieved when the convergence criteria are satisfied for the first
      inner iteration.<br />
      (default is 1e-5)</div>,
    relax: <div>is the relaxation parameter used with <strong>npcond</strong> = 1.<br />
      Usually, <strong>relax</strong> = 1.0, but for some problems a value of 0.99, 0.98, or 0.97 will reduce the
      number of iterations required for convergence. <strong>relax</strong> is not used
      if <strong>npcond</strong> is not 1.<br />

    nbpol: <div>is only used when <strong>npcond</strong> = 2 to indicate whether the estimate of the upper bound on

  pcgn: {
    iter_mo: <div>The maximum number of Picard (outer) iterations allowed.<br />
      For nonlinear problems, this variable must be set to some number greater than one, depending on the problem
      size and degree of nonlinearity.<br />
      If <strong>iter_mo</strong> is set to 1, then the PCGN solver assumes that the problem is linear and the
      input requirements are greatly truncated.<br />
      (default is 50)</div>,
    iter_mi: <div>The maximum number of PCG (inner) iterations allowed.<br />
      Generally, this variable is set to some number greater than one, depending on the matrix size, degree of
      convergence called for, and the nature of the problem. For a nonlinear
      problem, <strong>iter_mi</strong> should be set large enough that the PCG iteration converges freely with
      the relative convergence parameter epsilon &#949; described in the <em>Parameters Related to Convergence of
        Inner Iteration: Line 4</em> subsection.<br />
      (default is 30)</div>,
    close_r: <div>The residual-based stopping criterion for iteration. This parameter is used differently, depending
      on whether it is applied to a linear or nonlinear problem.<br />
      • If <strong>iter_mo</strong> = 1: For a linear problem, the variant of the conjugate gradient method
      outlined in algorithm 2 is employed, but uses the absolute convergence criterion in place of the relative
      convergence criterion. <strong>close_r</strong> is used as the value in the absolute convergence criterion
      for quitting the PCG iterative solver. <strong>close_r</strong> is compared to the square root of the
      weighted residual norm. In particular, if the square root of the weighted residual norm is less
      than <strong>close_r</strong>, then the linear PCG iterative solve is said to have converged, causing the
      PCG iteration to cease and control of the program to pass out of the PCG solver.<br /><br />
      • If <strong>iter_mo</strong> &#62; 1: For a nonlinear problem, <strong>close_r</strong> is used as a
      criterion for quitting the Picard (outer) iteration. <strong>close_r</strong> is compared to the square root
      of the inner product of the residuals (the residual norm) as calculated on entry to the PCG solver at the
      beginning of every Picard iteration. If this norm is less than <strong>close_r</strong>, then the Picard
      iteration is considered to have converged.</div>,
    close_h: <div>is used as an alternate stopping criterion for the Picard iteration needed to solve a nonlinear
      problem.<br /><br />
      The maximum value of the head change is obtained for each Picard iteration, after completion of the inner,
      PCG iteration. If this maximum head change is less than <strong>close_h</strong>, then the Picard iteration
      is considered tentatively to have converged. However, as nonlinear problems can demonstrate oscillation in
      the head solution, the Picard iteration is not declared to have converged unless the maximum head change is
      less than <strong>close_h</strong> for three Picard iterations. If these Picard iterations are sequential,
      then a good solution is assumed to have been obtained. If the Picard iterations are not sequential, then a
      warning is issued advising that the convergence is conditional and the user is urged to examine the mass
      balance of the solution.</div>,
    relax: <div>is the relaxation parameter used for the modified incomplete Cholesky (MIC) preconditioner (see
      algorithms 7 and 11); under MIC preconditioning, row sum agreement between the original matrix and the
      preconditioning matrix is created by pivot modification.<br /><br />
      When <strong>relax</strong> = 0, then the MIC corresponds to the ordinary incomplete Cholesky
      preconditioner, the effect of the modifications to the incomplete Cholesky having been nullified.
      When <strong>relax</strong> = 1, then these modifications are in full force.<br /><br />
      Generally speaking, it is of advantage to use the modifications to the incomplete Cholesky algorithm; a
      value of <strong>relax</strong> such that 0.9 &#60; <strong>relax</strong> &#60; 1 is generally advised for
      most problems. Values <strong>relax</strong> = 1 are not advised, particularly when <strong>ifill</strong> =
      0, as poor performance of the PCG solver may result (van der Vorst, 2003). However, experience has shown
      that a value close to 1, such as <strong>relax</strong> = 0.99, usually provides good performance.</div>,
    ifill: <div>is the fill level of the MIC preconditioner. Preconditioners with fill levels of 0 and 1 are
      available (<strong>ifill</strong> = 0 and <strong>ifill</strong> = 1, respectively).<br /><br />
      Generally, the higher the fill level, the more preconditioning imparted by a MIC preconditioner. However,
      the actual preconditioning provided is also influenced by the modification to the incomplete Cholesky
      algorithm (see <strong>relax</strong>).<br /><br />
      For most well-behaved CCFD matrices, a MIC preconditioner with fill level 0 will slightly outperform a MIC
      preconditioner with fill level 1, provided <strong>relax</strong> ≈ 1.<br />
      For problems where the matrix equation is not well behaved or for a nonlinear problem where convergence is
      not easily achieved, a fill level of 1 may provide the additional preconditioning necessary to obtain
      convergence.<br />
      One should be aware that the PCGN solver computer memory requirements of the level 1 MIC preconditioner are
      about double those of the level 0 preconditioner.
    </div>,
    unit_pc: <div>is the unit number of an optional output file where progress for the inner PCG iteration can be
      written.<br /><br />
      Progress diagnostics consist of the weighted residual norm νi for every iteration i of the PCG solver; this
      information is output for every time step and every Picard iteration in the simulation. If this option is
      used (<strong>unit_pc</strong> &gt; 0), the integer value of the unit, along with the file name and type
      “DATA,” should be given in the MODFLOW Name file (Harbaugh and others, 2000). In many instances, asking for
      this information will cause very large data files to be produced; it is not expected that this option will
      be used by most modelers.
    </div>,
    unit_ts: <div>is the unit number of an optional output file where the actual time in the PCG solver is
      accumulated.<br /><br />
      The object here is to capture actual PCG solver time rather than total run time. If this option is used
      (<strong>unit_ts</strong> &gt; 0), the integer value of the unit, along with the file name and type “DATA,”
      should be given in the MODFLOW Name file. It is not expected that this option will be used by most modelers.
    </div>,
    adamp: <div>defines the mode of damping applied to the linear solution. In general, damping determines how much
      of the head changes vector &#916;<sub>j</sub> shall be applied to the hydraulic head vector h<sub>j</sub> in
      Picard iteration j: h<sub>j</sub> = h<sub>j</sub>−1 +θ&#916;<sub>j</sub>, where θ is the damping
      parameter.<br /><br />
      • If <strong>adamp</strong> = 0, Ordinary damping is employed and a constant value of damping parameter will
      be used throughout the Picard iteration; this option requires a valid value
      for <strong>damp</strong>.<br /><br />
      • If <strong>adamp</strong> = 1, Adaptive damping is employed.<br /><br />
      • If <strong>adamp</strong> = 2, Enhanced damping algorithm in which the damping value is increased (but
      never decreased) provided the Picard iteration is proceeding satisfactorily.<br />(default is 0)</div>,
    damp: <div>is the damping factor. (default is 1)<br />
      Generally, 0 &#60; <strong>damp</strong> &#60; 1. Its function for the various modes
      of <strong>adamp</strong> are:<br />
      • <strong>adamp</strong> = 0: The damping parameter θ takes on the value <strong>damp</strong> and is
      maintained constant throughout the simulation.<br />
      • <strong>adamp</strong> &gt; 0: The value of <strong>damp</strong> will be treated as the upper limit for θ in
      the enhanced damping or adaptive damping algorithms.
    </div>,
    damp_lb: <div>is the lower bound placed on the dampening;<br />
      Generally, 0 &#60; <strong>damp_lb</strong> &#60; <strong>damp</strong>. For the various modes
      of <strong>adamp</strong> &gt; 0, <strong>damp_lb</strong> serves the following purposes:<br />
      • <strong>adamp</strong> = 1: In the adaptive damping algorithm, <strong>damp_lb</strong> represents the
      lower limit to which θ, under adverse adaptive damping conditions, will be allowed to fall.<br />
      • <strong>adamp</strong> = 2: In the enhanced damping algorithm, <strong>damp_lb</strong> is the starting
      value (or a component of the starting value) for the damping parameter θ used in the initial Picard
      iteration of every stress period.<br />
      (default is 0.001)</div>,
    rate_d: <div>is a rate parameter; generally, 0 &#60; <strong>rate_d</strong> &#60; 1.<br />
      For the various modes of <strong>adamp</strong> &gt; 0, <strong>rate_d</strong> serves the following
      purposes:<br />
      • <strong>adamp</strong> = 1: <strong>rate_d</strong> sets the recovery rate for the damping factor θ in
      response to the progress in the Picard iteration; it also forms a limit on the response function to progress
      in the Picard iteration. See algorithm 1 for usage when <strong>adamp</strong> = 1; in this
      algorithm, <strong>rate_d</strong> = ψ. Typical values for <strong>rate_d</strong>, under this scenario, are
      0.01 &#60; <strong>rate_d</strong> &#60; 0.1. Under adaptive damping, if the user finds that the damping
      factor θ increases too rapidly, then reducing <strong>rate_d</strong> will slow the rate of increase.<br />
      • <strong>adamp</strong> = 2: Provided the Picard iteration is progressing
      satisfactorily, <strong>rate_d</strong> adjusts the damping factor θ upward such that θj =
      θj−1+ <strong>rate_d</strong> θj−1, where j is the Picard iteration number. Typical values
      for <strong>rate_d</strong>, under this scenario, are 0.01 &#60; <strong>rate_d</strong> &#60; 0.1, although
      larger or smaller values may be used.<br />
      (default is 0.1)</div>,
    chglimit: <div>this variable limits the maximum head change applicable to the updated hydraulic heads in a
      Picard iteration. If <strong>chglimit</strong> = 0.0, then adaptive damping proceeds without this
      feature.<br />(default is 0.)</div>,
    acnvg: <div>defines the mode of convergence applied to the PCG solver.
      In general, the relative stopping criterion for PCG iteration is νi &#60; εν0, where ν0 is the weighted
      residual norm on entry to the PCG solver, ε is the relative convergence parameter, and νi is the same norm
      at PCG iteration i. The available convergence modes are:<br />
      • <strong>acnvg</strong> = 0: The standard convergence scheme is employed using the variant of the conjugate
      gradient method outlined in algorithm 3. The standard relative convergence is denoted by εs and usually
      takes the value 0.1; this value is assigned to the relative convergence ε. No additional variables are used.<br />
      • <strong>acnvg</strong> = 1: Adaptive convergence is employed using the variant of the conjugate gradient
      method outlined in algorithm 2. The adaptive convergence scheme adjusts the relative convergence ε of the
      PCG iteration based on a measure of the nonlinearity of the problem. Under this scheme, ε is allowed to vary
      such that CNVG_LB &#60; ε &#60; εs, where the exact value of ε is dependent on the measure of nonlinearity.
      This option requires a valid value for variable <strong>cnvg_lb</strong>.<br />
      • <strong>acnvg</strong> = 2: Enhanced convergence is employed using variant of the conjugate gradient
      method outlined in algorithm 3. If the variable enhancement option is employed (<strong>rate_c</strong> &gt;
      0), then εs is taken as the upper limit for ε; see <em>Limiting the Inner Iteration</em> subsection for
      details. This option requires valid values for variables <strong>mcnvg</strong> and <strong>rate_c</strong>.<br />
      (default is 0)</div>,
    cnvg_lb: <div>is the minimum value that the relative convergence is allowed to take under the self-adjusting
      convergence option. <strong>cnvg_lb</strong> is used only in convergence mode <strong>acnvg</strong> = 1.
      (default is 0.001)</div>,
    mcnvg: <div>increases the relative PCG convergence criteria by a power equal
      to <strong>mcnvg</strong>. <strong>mcnvg</strong> is used only in convergence mode <strong>acnvg</strong> =
      2. (default is 2)</div>,
    rate_c: <div>this option results in variable enhancement of epsilon.<br />
      If 0 &#60; <strong>rate_c</strong> &#60; 1, then enhanced relative convergence is allowed to decrease by
      increasing epsilon(<sub>j</sub>) = epsilon(<sub>j-1</sub>) + <strong>rate_c</strong> epsilon(<sub>j-1</sub>),
      where j is the Picard iteration number; this change in epsilon occurs so long as the Picard iteration is
      progressing satisfactorily.<br />
      If <strong>rate_c</strong> &#60;= 0, then the value of epsilon set by <strong>mcnvg</strong> remains
      unchanged through the Picard iteration. It should be emphasized that <strong>rate_c</strong> must have a
      value greater than 0 for the variable enhancement to be effected; otherwise epsilon remains
      constant. <strong>rate_c</strong> is used only in convergence mode <strong>acnvg</strong> = 2. (default is
      -1.)</div>,
    ipunit: <div>enables progress reporting for the Picard iteration.<br />
      If <strong>ipunit</strong> &gt;= 0, then a record of progress made by the Picard iteration for each time step
      is printed in the MODFLOW Listing file (Harbaugh and others, 2000). This record consists of the total number
      of dry cells at the end of each time step as well as the total number of PCG iterations necessary to obtain
      convergence. In addition, if <strong>ipunit</strong> &gt; 0, then extensive diagnostics for each Picard
      iteration is also written in comma-separated format to a file whose unit number corresponds
      to <strong>ipunit</strong>; the name for this file, along with its unit number and type ‘data’ should be
      entered in the modflow Name file. If <strong>ipunit</strong> &#60; 0 then printing of all progress
      concerning the Picard iteration is suppressed, as well as information on the nature of the convergence of
      the Picard iteration. (default is 0)</div>,

      equal to <strong>hclose</strong>, iteration stops. Commonly, <strong>hclose</strong> equals 0.01.</div>,
    hiclose: <div>is the head change criterion for convergence of the inner (linear) iterations, in units of length.
      When the maximum absolute value of the head change at all nodes during an iteration is less than or equal
      to <strong>hiclose</strong>, the matrix solver assumes convergence. Commonly, <strong>hiclose</strong> is
      set an order of magnitude less than <strong>hclose</strong>.</div>,
    mxiter: <div>is the maximum number of outer (nonlinear) iterations – that is, calls to the solution routine. For
      a linear problem <strong>mxiter</strong> should be 1.</div>,
    iter1: <div>is the maximum number of inner (linear) iterations. The number typically depends on the
      characteristics of the matrix solution scheme being used. For nonlinear
      problems, <strong>iter1</strong> usually ranges from 60 to 600; a value of 100 will be sufficient for most
      linear problems.</div>,
    iprsms: <div>is a flag that controls printing of convergence information from the solver:<br />
      • 0 is print nothing;<br />
      • 1 is print only the total number of iterations and nonlinear residual reduction summaries;<br />
      • 2 is print matrix solver information in addition to above.</div>,
    nonlinmeth: <div>is a flag that controls the nonlinear solution method and under- relaxation schemes.<br />
      • 0 is Picard iteration scheme is used without any under-relaxation schemes involved.<br />
      • &#62; 0 is Newton-Raphson iteration scheme is used with under-relaxation. Note that the Newton-Raphson
      linearization scheme is available only for the upstream weighted solution scheme of the BCF and LPF
      packages. <br />
      • &#60; 0 is Picard iteration scheme is used with under-relaxation. The absolute value
      of <strong>nonlinmeth</strong> determines the underrelaxation scheme used.<br />
      • 1 or -1, then Delta-Bar-Delta under-relaxation is used.<br />
      • 2 or -2 then Cooley under-relaxation scheme is used. Note that the under-relaxation schemes are used in
      conjunction with gradient based methods, however, experience has indicated that the Cooley under-relaxation
      and damping work well also for the Picard scheme with the wet/dry options of MODFLOW.</div>,
    linmeth: <div>is a flag that controls the matrix solution method.<br />
      • (1) use Ibaraki chi-MD matrix solver: an asymmetric matrix solver called ᵪMD (chi-MD) (Ibaraki,
      2005),<br />
      • (2) use White-Hughes matrix solver: an unstructured preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCGU) solver
      developed by White and Hughes (2011) for symmetric equations,<br />
      • (3) use SAMG matrix solver: the advanced/proprietary SAMG solver developed at the Frauenhofer Institute.
    </div>,
    theta: <div>is the reduction factor for the learning rate (under-relaxation term) of the delta-bar-delta
      algorithm. The value of <strong>theta</strong> is between zero and one. If the change in the variable (head)
      is of opposite sign to that of the previous iteration, the under-relaxation term is reduced by a factor
      of <strong>theta</strong>. The value usually ranges from 0.3 to 0.9; a value of 0.7 works well for most
      problems.</div>,
    akappa: <div>is the increment for the learning rate (under-relaxation term) of the delta-bar-delta algorithm.
      The value of <strong>akappa</strong> is between zero and one. If the change in the variable (head) is of the
      same sign to that of the previous iteration, the under-relaxation term is increased by an increment
      of <strong>akappa</strong>. The value usually ranges from 0.03 to 0.3; a value of 0.1 works well for most
      problems.</div>,
    gamma: <div>is the history or memory term factor of the delta-bar-delta algorithm. Gamma is between zero and 1
      but cannot be equal to one. When <strong>gamma</strong> is zero, only the most recent history (previous
      iteration value) is maintained. As <strong>gamma</strong> is increased, past history of iteration changes
      has greater influence on the memory term. The memory term is maintained as an exponential average of past
      changes. Retaining some past history can overcome granular behavior in the calculated function surface and
      therefore helps to overcome cyclic patterns of non-convergence. The value usually ranges from 0.1 to 0.3; a
      value of 0.2 works well for most problems.</div>,
    amomentum: <div>is the fraction of past history changes that is added as a momentum term to the step change for
      a nonlinear iteration. The value of <strong>amomentum</strong> is between zero and one. A large momentum
      term should only be used when small learning rates are expected. Small amounts of the momentum term help
      convergence. The value usually ranges from 0.0001 to 0.1; a value of 0.001 works well for most problems.
    </div>,
    numtrack: <div>is the maximum number of backtracking iterations allowed for residual reduction computations.
      If <strong>numtrack</strong> = 0 then the backtracking iterations are omitted. The value usually ranges from
      2 to 20; a value of 10 works well for most problems.</div>,
    btol: <div>is the tolerance for residual change that is allowed for residual reduction
      computations. <strong>btol</strong> should not be less than one to avoid getting stuck in local minima. A
      large value serves to check for extreme residual increases, while a low value serves to control step size
      more severely. The value usually ranges from 1.0 to 1e6 ; a value of 1e4 works well for most problems but
      lower values like 1.1 may be required for harder problems.</div>,
    breduc: <div>is the reduction in step size used for residual reduction computations. The value
      of <strong>breduc</strong> is between zero and one. The value usually ranges from 0.1 to 0.3; a value of 0.2
      works well for most problems.</div>,
    reslim: <div>is the limit to which the residual is reduced with backtracking. If the residual is smaller
      than <strong>reslim</strong>, then further backtracking is not performed. A value of 100 is suitable for
      large problems and residual reduction to smaller values may only slow down computations.</div>,
    iacl: <div>is the flag for choosing the acceleration method.<br />
      • (0) is Conjugate Gradient; select this option if the matrix is symmetric.<br />
      • (1) is ORTHOMIN.<br />
      • (2) is BiCGSTAB.</div>,
    norder: <div>is the flag for choosing the ordering scheme.<br />
      • (0) is original ordering<br />
      • (1) is reverse Cuthill McKee ordering<br />
      • (2) is Minimum degree ordering</div>,
    level: <div>is the level of fill for ILU decomposition. Higher levels of fill provide more robustness but also
      require more memory. For optimal performance, it is suggested that a large level of fill be applied (7 or 8)
      with use of drop tolerance.</div>,
    north: <div>is the number of orthogonalizations for the ORTHOMIN acceleration scheme. A number between 4 and 10
      is appropriate. Small values require less storage but more iteration may be required. This number should
      equal 2 for the other acceleration methods.</div>,
    iredsys: <div>is the index for creating a reduced system of equations using the red-black ordering scheme. 0 is
      do not create reduced system 1 is create reduced system using red-black ordering</div>,
    rrctol: <div>is a residual tolerance criterion for convergence. The root mean squared residual of the matrix
      solution is evaluated against this number to determine convergence. The solver assumes convergence if
      either <strong>hiclose</strong> (the absolute head tolerance value for the solver)
      or <strong>rrctol</strong> is achieved. Note that a value of zero ignores residual tolerance in favor of the
      absolute tolerance (<strong>hiclose</strong>) for closure of the matrix solver.</div>,
    idroptol: <div>is the flag to perform drop tolerance. 0 is do not perform drop tolerance 1 is perform drop
      tolerance.</div>,
    epsrn: <div>is the drop tolerance value. A value of 10<sup>-3</sup> works well for most problems.</div>,
    clin: <div>is an option keyword that defines the linear acceleration method used by the PCGU
      solver. <strong>clin</strong> is “CG”, then preconditioned conjugate gradient
      method. <strong>clin</strong> is “BCGS”, then preconditioned bi-conjugate gradient stabilized method.</div>,
    ipc: <div>is an integer value that defines the preconditioner.<br />
      • <strong>ipc</strong> = 0, No preconditioning.<br />
      • <strong>ipc</strong> = 1, Jacobi preconditioning.<br />
      • <strong>ipc</strong> = 2, ILU(0) preconditioning.<br />
      • <strong>ipc</strong> = 3, MILU(0) preconditioning (default).</div>,
    iscl: <div>is the flag for choosing the matrix scaling approach used.<br />
      • (0) is no matrix scaling applied <br />
      • (1) is symmetric matrix scaling using the scaling method by the POLCG preconditioner in Hill (1992). <br />
      • (2) is symmetric matrix scaling using the l2 norm of each row of A (DR) and the l2 norm of each row of
      DRA.</div>,
    iord: <div>is the flag for choosing the matrix reordering approach used.<br />
      • 0 = original ordering<br />
      • 1 = reverse Cuthill McKee ordering<br />
      • 2 = minimum degree ordering</div>,
    rclosepcgu: <div>is a real value that defines the flow residual tolerance for convergence of the PCGU linear
      solver. This value represents the maximum allowable residual at any single node. Value is in units of length
      cubed per time, and must be consistent with MODFLOW-USG length and time units. Usually a value of 1.0x10-1
      is sufficient for the flow-residual criteria when meters and seconds are the defined MODFLOW-USG length and
      time.</div>,
    relaxpcgu: <div>is a real value that defines the relaxation factor used by the MILU(0)
      preconditioner. <strong>relaxpcgu</strong> is unitless and should be greater than or equal to 0.0 and less
      than or equal to 1.0. <strong>relaxpcgu</strong> values of about 1.0 are commonly used, and experience
      suggests that convergence can be optimized in some cases with <strong>relaxpcgu</strong> values of 0.97.
      A <strong>relaxpcgu</strong> value of 0.0 will result in ILU(0)
      preconditioning. <strong>relaxpcgu</strong> is only specified if <strong>ipc</strong>=3.
      If <strong>relaxpcgu</strong> is not specified and <strong>ipc</strong>=3, then a default value of 0.97 will
      be assigned to <strong>relaxpcgu</strong>.</div>,
