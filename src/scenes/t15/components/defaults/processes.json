    "TreatmentName": "UV disinfection 40 mJ/cm2, drinking",
    "TreatmentGroup": "Primary disinfection",
    "TreatmentDescription": "UV-light is mostly effective at 254 nm where it affects DNA or RNA thus preventing reproduction of the organism (inactivation). Log reduction for drinking water UV is based on closed UV-reactors wich have been validated according to appropriate standards (e.g. USEPA or DVGW). Effectiveness of disinfection depends on delivered fluence (dose in mJ/cm2), which varies with lamp intensity, exposure time (flow rate) and UV-absorption by the water (organics). Excessive turbidity and certain dissolved species inhibit this process; hence, turbidity should be kept below 1 NTU to support effective disinfection."

    "TreatmentGroup": "Coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation",
    "TreatmentDescription": "Consists of coagulant and/or flocculant aid (e.g. polymer) dosing, rapid mixing, slow mixing and sedimentation. Log removal depends on process optimisation.
