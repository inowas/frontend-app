  "dalys_per_case": "expresses the severity of the illness, which is multiplied with the illness probability for calculating the DALYs of each event",
  "dose_response": "Dose response relationships of the selected pathogens to estimate the severity of infections. The dose â€“ response models are based on experimental data, see e.g. http://qmrawiki.msu.edu/index.php?title=Dose_Response. https://kwb-r.github.io/qmra.db/articles/database_content.html#dose-response",
  "exposure": "Ingested volume per event defines the end-use of water after treatment train. Potable and nonpotable end-use can be defined.",
  "health": "For calculating the health risk of each event, expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALY), the following two health parameters for each pathogen are required: https://kwb-r.github.io/qmra.db/articles/database_content.html#health",
  "infection_to_illness": "constant factor by which the infection probability is multiplied for converting into an illness probability",
  "inflow": "The microbiological risk assessment starts with the selection and inflow characterisation of relevant pathogens. It is recommended to select at least one pathogen for bacteria, protozoa and virus. The Probability Density Function (PDF) is the basis for the probabilistic risk assessment. Input data is considered to be highly variable and quantified by using the PDF.",
  "number_of_exposures": "Number of exposure events per year: determines how often random values for the input parameters inflow concentration and treatment train reduction are drawn.",
  "number_of_repeatings": "For each exposure scenario, treatment scheme and pathogen, the risk calculation is repeated by predefined Monte Carlo runs. At least 1000 runs are recommended.",
  "processes": "The selection of treatment steps and associated log-reductions for each pathogen group and treatment step."
